-- Loan Approval Model
-- import lib, dataset, 
-- create new col, 
-- null values - filled, 
-- trained & tested
-- looked for people took loan & grouped by gender / Marttial status / Dependents / Self Employed / LoanAmount / Credit History 
-- Fit & Transform data for training 
-- import standardscaler : #Removes mean and scales each feature variable to unit variance, featurewise in an independent way
-- Meta estimator to increase predictive accuracy & to reduce overfitting 
-- #Naive Bayes Classifier : GaussianNB #Classification algo for binary 2 & multi classes classi prob
-- #Decision Tree Classifier : #Non-parametric supervised learning approach used for class & regre applications 
-- #K Neighbors Classifier: #5 closest neighbors are sort for KNCs
-- #The classification system with the highest accuracy would be used for the Loan Approval System 
-- Used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn,
