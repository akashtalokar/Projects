--- Telco Churn Analysis 
-- Taking sample dataset for Telco customer data & showing the customers who left 
-- Loaded the Sample Data CSV File & checked for attributes like shape, columns, datatypes, and descriptive statitics for numeric variables 
	-- Results/Inferences::SeniorCitizen is actually a categorical hence the 25%-50%-75% distribution is not propoer, 75% customers have tenure less than 55 months, Average Monthly charges are USD 64.76 whereas 25% customers pay more than USD 89.85 per month
-- Data is highly imbalanced, ratio = 73:27 from value_counts, So we analyse the data with other features while taking the target values separately to get some insights.
-- Performed Data Cleaning by creating a copy, checked missing values, & removed them as the % of this values was very low, Divided customers based on tenure of 12 months, removed unrequired columns 
-- Data Exploration: Plot distribution of individual predictors by churn, Convert the target variable 'Churn' in a binary numeric variable, Convert all the categorical variables into dummy variables, Relationship between Monthly Charges and Total Charges, 
	-- -- Total Charges increase as Monthly Charges increase - as expected.
-- Churn by Monthly Charges and Total Charges, 
	-- Churn is high when Monthly Charges ar high
-- Build a corelation of all predictors with 'Churn'
	-- These are some of the quick insights from this exercise:
	Electronic check medium are the highest churners
	Contract Type - Monthly customers are more likely to churn because of no contract terms, as they are free to go customers.
	No Online security, No Tech Support category are high churners
	Non senior Citizens are high churners
	Note: There could be many more such insights, so take this as an assignment and try to get more insights :)
