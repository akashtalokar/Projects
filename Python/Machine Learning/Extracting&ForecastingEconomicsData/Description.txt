--  To Extract Live Economics data from FRED & do forecasting on the extracted economic data 
-- Gonna Extract CPI using FRED API Keys
-- Will Clean it and make that data ready for Time Series Forecasting using Fbs Univariate TS forecasting model called Prophet 
-- Once we get the Forecasted or predicted values, will do TS cross validation to check the accuracy or to evaluate the model 
## Forecast Economics data in Python 
-- Used Fred Api which helped to create a live connection with FRED to extract the data 
-- Extracted the data for CPI for all urbun consumers from FRED site 	& extracted all datapoints 
-- Fitted in the dataset & the DF into a Prophet model 
-- Fitted a Forecasting model to create future DFs & asked the model to predict the values 
-- Performed Cross Validation to evaluate the model's accuracy by splitting entire data and running multiple trends on it & performance by calculating mae,mse & rsme 
-- Results/Inferences:: 
-- Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, FredApi, Plotly, Prophet,

--- Explore Real World Economic Data using Python & Pandas 
-- Created the Fred Object by Pull down that data directly from FRED using the Free API key 
-- API Setup: Requesting API 
-- Search Economic Indicators 
-- Pull Economic Data 
-- Serached for economic indicator, pulled raw data & plotted it 
-- Joining Indicators: Pull few different timeseries datasets through each Id  & merged[join] them & Plot then compare unemp_rate 
-- pulling each states unemp_rate on that date where seen a big jump in the unemp, 
-- created dict to map ids with state names, 
-- Looked for another metrics i.e Participationrate, & plotted both graphs & compared 
-- Results/Inferences::
-- Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, FredApi, Plotly, use of web apis,
